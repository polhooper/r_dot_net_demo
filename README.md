# r_dot_net_demo
Some experimental code demoing some very basic R/.NET/C# integrations. 

`demo.cs` is an adaptation of the `Program.cs` code available at https://rdotnet.codeplex.com/. The goal here is to create an extremely simple example that ingests data that is encoded as a numeric vector in C# and to pass that data to an R engine that applies statistical functions to it.
